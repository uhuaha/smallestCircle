This Python program calculates the smallest circle sourrounding a finite set of points by using Welzl's algorithm
implemented according to the pseudo code at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest-circle_problem#Welzl's_algorithm.
After the algorithm was successful the data points and the circle are visualized.

The code was compiled using Python 3.6.

The following additional libraries are used
- matplotlib.pyplot
- random
- math
- sympy.geometry

To run the code execute "~$ python main.py" in the shell.
